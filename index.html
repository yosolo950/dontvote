                <h2>Vivek is an Anchor Baby</h2>

                <h2>Vivek Received Money from Soros</h2>
                <p>In 2011 Vivek accepted a $90,000 award from the Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans, which was founded by Daisy and Paul Soros, the late older brother of George Soros. He claimed he needed the money to afford Law School but his tax returns show he was already a multi millionaire at that time.
